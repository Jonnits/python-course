# Exercise 1.2: Recipe Data Structures - Learning Journal

## Date: 12.01.2025

## What I Learned

### Data Structures
- **Dictionaries**: Learned how to use dictionaries to store structured data with key-value pairs. Dictionaries provide semantic access to data through meaningful keys rather than positional indices.
- **Lists**: Understood how lists can be used to store multiple related items sequentially, allowing for easy iteration and modification.

### Key Concepts
- Choosing appropriate data structures based on use case
- Nested data structures (dictionaries within lists)
- Accessing nested data using bracket notation
- Building a data model for a Recipe app

## Challenges Faced

- Renaming folders and moving dictionaries within lists
- Referencing specific details within previously added dictionaries (e.g. ingredients).

## Solutions Found

- Referencing online forums and IPython documentation allowed me to precisely identify the issue I was facing and resolve it thoroughly, so that I can continue with my projects with minimal disruption (and preparation in case of unforeseen future changes)
- Proper syntax for navigating through previously-added dictionaries and access to print precise details (e.g. ingredients).

## Reflection

- Learning the importance of good structural discipline for projects
- Navigating the IPython terminal and using its added functionality
- Establishing projects in a professional, scalable manner
- Referencing and printing previously added data and particular details.

## Code Examples

### Creating a Recipe Dictionary
```python
recipe_1 = {
    'name': 'Tea',
    'cooking_time': 5,
    'ingredients': ['Tea leaves', 'Sugar', 'Water']
}
```

### Creating a List of Recipes
```python
all_recipes = []
all_recipes.append(recipe_1)
```
