# Recipe Application

This is a Django web application for managing recipes. Users can create recipes with ingredients, cooking times, and descriptions. The application also allows users to search for recipes by their ingredients.

The application uses Django's admin interface for recipe management and provides a foundation for building a full-featured recipe sharing platform.
